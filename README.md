## üéôÔ∏è Quick Warm-Up: Why Gulp Still Matters in 2025

It‚Äôs the middle of the third quarter, your team‚Äôs trailing, and the playbook‚Äôs bloated with tools you barely need. You‚Äôre not shipping the ball fast enough. In this modern front-end game ‚Äî sometimes, **going lean and simple wins you more than over-engineering ever could**.

**Enter Gulp.**
A task runner that, in 2025, still punches above its weight for static web projects. When your React build takes 90 seconds and your Vite stack needs config patches for a brochure site, a clean Gulp workflow can ship that MVP faster than your coffee cools down.
